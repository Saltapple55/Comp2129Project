Changes to Comp2129 Project
General Changes
- added abstract class Manager, with enforced ToString(), checkDuplicate()
-almost all methods in manager classs that pull information from other managers has been moved to Coordinator

Customer/Customermanager
-made constructor public instead of private for CustomerManager
-removed adding int id from Customer constructor/addCustomer()
-made customer id variable static
-added Property NumCustomer, with only a getter
-added ToString() to CustomerManager, which returns string - all the customers. returns customers.
-converted methods to camelCase
-convert variables to camelCase
-checkIfDuplicate is now a private helper method checkCustomerExists, used in viewCustomer and Add Customer
-changed all instances of "foreach(Customer in Customers)"to "for (int i = 0; i < numCustomers; i++)" to speed up code and reduce unnecessary breaks/null checks. Also changed customer.method to customerList[i].method
-removed ID number and Booking number from Customer.ToString() as instructions only want name and phone
-changed removeCustomer to be boolean, removed Console.WriteLines(). Added code to actually remove customer from list instead of just reducing numCustomers
	-removeCustomer changed from accepting id, which user cannot see, to accepting index. This works in conjuction with static getValidIndexInput().
-viewCustomer has been implemented. Most code was just copy pasted from checkCustomerExists, but returns Customer
